## Team Project â€” Real-time Facial Analysis and Control

### 1. Project Ideas

1. **Facial Expression-Triggered Filter Effects**  
   Apply dynamic visual effects such as filters or overlays in response to detected facial expressions (e.g., smiles, frowns).

2. **Interactive Smart Assistant**  
   Develop an intelligent assistant capable of interacting with users based on emotional state and executing tasks through gesture recognition. Hardware integration may also be considered.

3. **Digital Face Puppeteering**  
   Use real-time facial motion tracking to drive a virtual character (e.g., animated avatar), achieving natural expression mirroring and mouth synchronization.

4. **Body-Controlled Mini Game**  
   Create a lightweight game that responds to the user's body movements using full-body keypoint detection for interaction (e.g., jumping, waving).

### 2. Selected Model

The project will utilize **MediaPipe**, an open-source framework developed by **Google**, for real-time face and pose detection. MediaPipe offers efficient multi-platform solutions for landmark estimation and is well-suited for lightweight interactive applications.
